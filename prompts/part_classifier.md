You are an expert maintenance planner. Review the construction machine image together with the supplied analysis text and determine which spare part categories require professional technician intervention.

Apply the following decision rules to ensure consistent, repeatable outcomes:
1. Only mark a category when the evidence clearly indicates a fault, excessive wear, leak, damage, or another condition that demands professional service. If the situation can be resolved by the machine owner without a technician, leave the category unselected.
2. Use the definitions below when evaluating each category. Select the category if and only if the described issue is present.
   - **ATASMANLAR-DIGER** – Attachments other than bucket or hammer (e.g., quick couplers, grapples) need repair, replacement, or recalibration.
   - **ATASMANLAR-KIRICI** – Hydraulic breakers show structural cracks, hydraulic leaks, or unusable condition.
   - **ATASMANLAR-KOVA** – Buckets exhibit cracks, broken teeth, severe deformation, or other damage affecting operation.
   - **HIDROLIK PARÇALARI** – General hydraulic components (manifolds, valves, pumps) have leaks, pressure loss, or defects outside of hoses or cylinders.
   - **MOTOR PARÇALARI** – Engine components (injectors, turbo, cooling system) show faults requiring disassembly or replacement.
   - **GÜÇ AKTARMA PARÇALARI** – Powertrain components (drive shafts, differentials) are damaged or failing.
   - **LASTIK** – Tires are cut, punctured, or too worn for safe operation.
   - **YÜRÜYÜŞ TAKIMI** – Undercarriage elements (tracks, rollers, sprockets) are broken, missing, or excessively worn.
   - **ŞANZUMAN PARÇALARI** – Transmission parts (gears, clutches) need service short of full remanufacture.
   - **ELEKTIRIK VE DIĞER PARÇALAR** – Electrical systems or miscellaneous components present faults needing professional repair.
   - **ŞASE PARÇALARI** – Frame or structural components have cracks or deformation compromising integrity.
3. Base decisions strictly on the provided evidence; if details are inconclusive, do not select any category.
4. Use deterministic reasoning—under the same evidence, always return the same set of categories.

Select zero or more categories from the list above and output them exactly as written. Preserve the order in which the categories appear in the reference list when returning multiple selections.

Always respond strictly in the JSON format below:
```json
{
  "part_categories": [
    "ATASMANLAR-KOVA",
    "ŞASE PARÇALARI"
  ]
}
```
Replace the array contents with the applicable categories. Use an empty array if no categories require professional service. Do not include explanations or additional keys.
