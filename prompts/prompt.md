**Analyze the attached machine component image and identify any visible issues related to mechanical diagnostics.**  

Focus on detecting potential technical problems such as oil leaks, wear and tear, cracks, rust, deformation, exhaust smoke color changes, hydraulic oil color changes, missing or broken parts (especially at joints, brackets, or attachment points), structural dents or chassis deformations, or other signs of failure. Pay close attention to gaps or abnormalities at connection points that may indicate a missing bolt, bracket, or support. Only report findings that are clearly visible and avoid speculative conclusions.

### **Analysis Requirements**  
- Clearly describe each observed issue in a structured manner.  
- Explain the possible impact on machine performance.  
- Analyze the potential root causes of these faults.  
- Provide necessary maintenance or repair recommendations.

### **Response Guidelines**  
- Use a professional and technical tone appropriate for industry professionals.  
- Structure the response into well-organized paragraphs.  
- Write the response in **{language_name}**.  

### **Output Format**  
- The response should be **detailed yet concise**, avoiding unnecessary explanations.  
- Use a **logical flow**, ensuring each issue is addressed with its cause and recommended action.  
- **Example structure for each identified problem:**  
- **Issue:** [Brief description]  
- **Impact:** [How it affects machine performance]  
- **Potential Causes:** [Possible reasons behind the issue]  
- **Recommended Action:** [Suggested maintenance or repair steps]  

### **Examples**

#### **Example Response (English)**  
**Issue:** Oil leakage detected at the transmission housing.  
**Impact:** Oil loss can result in insufficient lubrication, leading to gear wear, overheating, and potential transmission failure.  
**Potential Causes:** Damaged gaskets, loose bolts, or cracks in the housing.  
**Recommended Action:** Inspect the transmission housing for cracks, tighten or replace bolts, and replace faulty gaskets if necessary.

#### **Example Response (English)**  
**Issue:** Missing hydraulic pipe bracket near the main cylinder.  
**Impact:** Missing support may cause pipe vibration, leading to potential wear, leakage, or breakage over time.  
**Potential Causes:** Mechanical stress, previous improper repair, or accidental damage during operation.  
**Recommended Action:** Replace the missing bracket immediately and inspect nearby connections for signs of stress or damage.

#### **Example Response (English)**  
**Issue:** Visible chassis dent on the left rear lower frame.  
**Impact:** Structural deformation may compromise stability, alignment, or load distribution, potentially leading to operational safety risks.  
**Potential Causes:** Impact from external object, rollover, or incorrect lifting procedure.  
**Recommended Action:** Assess the severity of the deformation, consult structural guidelines, and perform repair or reinforcement as necessary.

### **Notes**
- The actual response must be tailored to the specific issues observed in the provided image.
- Do not assume or imagine damages that are not clearly visible. Reflections, lighting effects, or surface irregularities must not be interpreted as cracks, fractures, or defects without clear visual confirmation.
- Findings must strictly be based on verified and obvious observations from the image.
- While describing the issues, consider the specific part(s) shown in the image and ensure that the response is relevant to the component(s) being inspected.      

**Findings must only be reported if they are clearly visible, unambiguous, and fully verifiable from the image. Any unclear, assumed, or speculative observations must not be included under any circumstances.**
